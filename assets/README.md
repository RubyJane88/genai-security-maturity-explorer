## Adding the Dashboard Screenshot

To add the preview image for the README:

1. **Take a screenshot of your dashboard**:

   - Open the live dashboard at http://localhost:8050 or your deployed URL
   - Make sure it shows the interactive heatmap and key features
   - Recommended size: 1200x800 pixels or larger

2. **Save the screenshot**:

   - Save as `preview.png` in this directory
   - PNG format recommended for best quality

3. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add assets/preview.png
   git commit -m "docs: Add dashboard preview screenshot"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Screenshot Tips

**Good screenshot should show**:

- ✅ The interactive heatmap (main feature)
- ✅ Control panel (year selector, dark mode toggle)
- ✅ At least one additional chart (gap analysis or radar)
- ✅ Clean, professional appearance
- ✅ Full browser window (shows it's a web app)

**Tool recommendations**:

- macOS: Cmd+Shift+4 (then Space to capture window)
- Windows: Windows+Shift+S
- Browser extensions: Awesome Screenshot, FireShot
- Professional: Take screenshot in incognito mode for clean interface
